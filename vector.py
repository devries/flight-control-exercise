"""3-D vector library. This library is designed to make working with
vectors as easy as working with regular numbers. The main class is the Threevec
class which stores the vectors in recangular coordinates and allows
standard operations. There are generator functions to return vectors defined
in rectangular coordinates, cylindrical coordinates, and spherical coordinates.
This is an extension of a vector library in C which I started developing in
1993 and was later ported to Java and now Python.
